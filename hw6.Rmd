## Q1 
```{r}

    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = if_else(str_detect(disposition, "Closed"), 1, 0)
  ) %>%

    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  )
```

```{r}
# 1. Filter to Baltimore
balt <- homi %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

# 2. Fit logistic regression and save model object
fit_balt <- glm(
  solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
  data = balt,
  family = binomial()
)

# 3. Tidy results with ORs and 95% CI
results_balt <- broom::tidy(
  fit_balt,
  exponentiate = TRUE,

# 4. Display OR for all predictors (or filter)
results_balt %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%   
  select(term, OR = estimate, conf.low, conf.high, p.value) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

```{r}

city_results <- homi %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    fit = map(data, ~ glm(
      solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
      data = .x,
      family = binomial()
    )),

  unnest(tidy_fit) %>%

city_results
```

```{r}
city_results %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%   # order by OR
  ggplot(aes(x = OR, y = city_state)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high),
                 height = 0.2, color = "gray40") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted Odds Ratios (Male vs Female Victims) by City",
    x = "Adjusted Odds Ratio (Male vs Female)",
    y = "City"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Compared to female, males on average are less likely to have their cases solved. As from the plot, we can see most cities' odds ratios fall under 1.
